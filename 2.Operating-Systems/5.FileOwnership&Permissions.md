# File Ownership & Permissions
- User permissions are related to reading, writing and executing files
- Each file and folder has 2 different owners (user + group)

### 3 types of rights
- Read
- Write
- Execute

### 3 categories of access
- Owner = user who owns the file/folder
- Group = group that owns the file/folder
- Others = People who aren't part of the owning group or is not the owner

**By default, owner is the user, who created the file**
**Owning group is the primary group of that user**

### Change ownership
```bash
chown <username>:<groupname> <filename>
```

**List file permissions**, by printing files in a long listing format (`ls -l`):

### 3 ways to set or change permission
- Symbolic Mode

  |--------|-------------|
  | u | Owner | 
  | g | Group| 
  | o | Other| 
  | + | add | 
  | \- | remove| 
  | r | Read| 
  | w | Write| 
  | \- | No Permission| 

- Set permission: set the permission and override the permissions set earlier
- Numeric Mode:
  | Number | Description |
  |--------|-------------|
  | 4 | Read |
  | 2 | Write |
  | 1 | Execute |
  | 0 | No Permission | 

### Adding or removing permissions
Example: 
```bash
sudo chmod g-w config.yaml
```
Means: Remove write permission of group owner from config.yaml file

### Set the whole permission
Example:
```bash
sudo chmod g=rwx config.yaml
sudo chmod o=r-x config.yaml
```
Means: 
Set read, write and execute permission for group for config.yaml file   
Set read and execute permission for others for config.yaml file

### Set permission with numeric values
Example:
```bash
sudo chmod 740 script.sh
```
Means: Sets full permissions for the owner, read-only for the group, and nothing for the other users.
