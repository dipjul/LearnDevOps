# SSH: Secure Shell

## Introduction to SSH
- SSH or Secure Shell is a network protocol, that enables two computers to communicate securely
- It protects the communications security and integrity with strong encryption

**Use case**
- Often used to "login" and perform tasks on remote computers, like installing software on a new server or to copy a file to the server

**How it works?**
- The protocol works in the client-server model
- Meaning you use a program on your computer (ssh client) to connect to the remote server (SSH server)
- For that you can use a graphical user interface, but mostly the CLI

## 2 ways to authenticate
- **Username & Password**
  - Admin creates a user on the remote server
  - User can then connect with the username and password

- **SSH Key Pair**
  - Client creates a SSH Key Pair `Key Pair = Private Key + Public Key`
  - *Private Key* = Secret key. Is stored securely on the client machine
  - *Public Key* = Public. Can be shared, e.g. with the remote server
  - If public key of a person is not registered on the remote server, they cannot connect to it

## SSH for Services
- Services, like Jenkins, often need to connect to another server via SSH
- **How to**
  - Create Jenkins User on application server
  - Create SSH key pair on Jenkins server
  - Add public key to authorized_keys on application server

## Firewall and Port 22
- SSH service (on SSH server) runs on port 22
- That's why in firewall rule, we need to allow access on that port
- But also configure the source (who can access the server on that port). Because SSH is powerful and needs to be restricted to specific IP addresses
- `ssh UserName@SSHserver` Connect to a remote host
- `~/.ssh` `.ssh` under home directory is the default location for your ssh key pair
- known_hosts file : Lets the client authenticate the server to check that it isn't connecting to an impersonator
- authorized_keys file : Let's the server authenticate the user
