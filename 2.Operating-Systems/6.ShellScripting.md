# Shell Scripting
## Why Shell Scripting?
- When administering servers, you need to execute tons of commands
  - `useradd dip`
  - `groupadd devops`
  - `mkdir temp`
  - `touch 1.txt`
  - `chmod 750 /temp`
  - `sudo apt docker`
  - docker run ...
- Instead of executing the command one by one, you can save the commands in a file and execute that file. 
- Such file is called a shell script.
- File extension is `.sh`
- Automate all your work:
  - Backup scripts -> Monitoring scripts -> Server Configuration scripts
- Avoid repetitive work
- Keep history of configuration
- Share the instructions
- Logic & Bulk Operations

## How to execute Shell Scripts?
**Shell**
- The program that interprets and executes the various commands that we type in the terminal
- Translates our command that the OS Kernel can understand

**Different Shell implementations**  
- ***sh***
  - Bourne Shell - /bin/sh

- ***Bash***
  - Bourne again shell - /bin/bash
  - Improved version of sh
  - Default shell program for most UNIX like systems
  - Bash is a shell program and a programming language

- Shell and Bash terms are often used interchangeable
- All shell script files have the same .sh file extension

**How OS knows which shell to use?**
- We need to tell the OS
- *SH* - `#!/bin/sh`
- *BASH* - `#!/bin/bash`
- *ZSH* - `#!/bin/zsh`

This is called "shebang" because of the first 2 characters "#!"
- `#` = in musical notation, also called "sharp"
- `!` = also called "bang"
- Shebang became a shortening of sharp-bang

**Make shell script executable**
- To execute a shell script, you need to make it executable first, by adding executing permission
```bassh
sudo chmod u+x first.sh # execute permission to user(owner)
sudo chmod g+x first.sh # execute permission to group
sudo chmod o+x first.sh # execute permission to other
```

## Writing Shell Scripts
**Variables**
- Used to store data and can be referenced later
- Similar to variables in general programminglanguages
- Store output of a command in a variable:
  `variable_name=$(command)`
  
**Conditionals**
- Allow you to alter the control flow of the program
- E.g. execute a command only when a certain condition is true
  ```bash
  if [ condition ]
  then
    statement
  elif [ condition ]
  then
    statement
  else
    statement
  fi
  ```
**`[ ... ]` builtin command**
- Square brackets enclose expressions
- It's a shorthand notation for the "test" command
  - if test -d "config" is the same

**Boolean**
- A datatype that can only have 2 values:
  - True
  - False
- Bash does have Boolean expressions in terms of comparison and conditions

**File Test Operators**
- Test various properties associated with a file:


| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| -b file	| Checks if file is a block special file; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	| [ -b $file ] | |
| -c file	| Checks if file is a character special file; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	| [ -c $file ] | |
| -d file	| Checks if file is a directory; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	| [ -d $file ] | is not true.
| -f file	| Checks if file is an ordinary file as opposed to a directory or special file; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	| [ -f $file ] |
| -g file	| Checks if file has its set group ID (SGID) bit set; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	| [ -g $file ] |
| -k file	| Checks if file has its sticky bit set; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	| [ -k $file ] |
| -p file	| Checks if file is a named pipe; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	| [ -p $file ] |
| -t file	| Checks if file descriptor is open and associated with a terminal; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	| [ -t $file ] |
| -u file	| Checks if file has its Set User ID (SUID) bit set; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	| [ -u $file ] |
| -r file	| Checks if file is readable; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	| [ -r $file ] |
| -w file	| Checks if file is writable; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	| [ -w $file ] |
| -x file	| Checks if file is executable; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	| [ -x $file ] |
| -s file	| Checks if file has size greater than 0; if yes, then condition becomes true.	| [ -s $file ] |
| -e file	| Checks if file exists; is true even if file is a directory but exists.	| [ -e $file ] |

**Relational Operators**
- Works only for numeric values
- Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20 then:

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
|-eq |  Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	| [ $a -eq $b ] is not true|
|-ne |	Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not; if values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.	| [ $a -ne $b ] is true|
|-gt |	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	| [ $a -gt $b ] is not true|
|-lt |	Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	| [ $a -lt $b ] is true|
|-ge |	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	| [ $a -ge $b ] is not true|
|-le |	Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.	| [ $a -le $b ] is true|

**String Operators**
- Test strings for equality and more
- Assume variable a holds "abc" and variable b holds "efg" then:

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| =	    | Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not; if yes, then the condition becomes true |	[ $a = $b ] is not true |
| !=	| Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not; if values are not equal then the condition becomes true |	[ $a != $b ] is true |
| -z	| Checks if the given string operand size is zero; if it is zero length, then it returns true |	[ -z $a ] is not true |
| -n	| Checks if the given string operand size is non-zero; if it is nonzero length, then it returns true |	[ -n $a ] is not false |
| str	| Checks if str is not the empty string; if it is empty, then it returns false |	[ $a ] is not false |


**Passing arguments to a script**
- You can pass arguments when executing a script
  ```bash
  read -p "Please enter your name: " user_name
  echo "You name is $username"
  ```
- We can read these passed parameters using special variables

**Positional Parameters**
- Arguments passed to script are processed in the same order in which they're sent
- The indexing of arguments starts at 1: `$1`
- `$*` = represent all the arguments as a single string
- `$#` = Total number of arguments provided
- `$?` - captures value returned by last command
**Loops**
- Enables you to execute a set of commands repeatedly
- There are different types of loops:
  - while loop
  - for loop
  - until loop
  - select loop

***For Loop***
- Operates on lists of items
- Repeats a set of commands for every item in the list
```bash
for var in word1 word2 ...
do
  statement(s) to be executed for every word
done

# Example
for param in $*
do
  if [ -d "$param" ]
    then
      echo "directory $param exist"
  fi
  echo $param
done
```

***While Loop***
- Executes a set of commands repeatedly until some condition is matched
```bash
while condition
do
  statement(s) to be executed if command is true
done

# Example
count=0
while [ "$count" -lt "$#" ]
do
  echo "count: $count"
  count=$((count+1))
done
```

***Functions***
- Enables you to break down the overall functionality of a script into smaller, logical code blocks
- This code block can then be referenced ("called") anywhere in the script multiple times
- You can accept parameters in a function
- The parameters passed in are represented by $1, $2, etc.

```bash
function iterate {
  count=0
  while [ "$count" -lt 5 ]
  do
    echo "count: $count"
    count=$((count+1))
  done
}
iterate
```

****Function Paramaters****
```bash
function create_file() {
  filename=$1
  touch $filename
  echo "$filename created."
}

create_file hello.txt
create_file bye.sh
```
```bash
function sum() {
  total=$(($1+$2))
  return $total
}

sum 2 10
result=$?
echo "Result: $result"
```
