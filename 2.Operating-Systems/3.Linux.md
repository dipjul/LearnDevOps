# Linux
- Linux was developed in parallel to
- Unix based operating systems
- No source code of UNIX
- Created by Linus Torvalds
- Clone of UNIX or also called "unix like"
- Linux and MacOS both POSIX compliant

## Linux File System
- File system is used to handle the data management of the storage
- The Linux file system has a hierarchical tree structure With 1 root folder

## Everything in Linux is a File
- Everything in the system is represented by a file descriptor
- Text documents, pictures etc
- Commands, like pwd, ls etc
- Devices like printer, keyboard, usb
- Even directories. Linux makes no difference between a file and adirectory, since a directory is just a file containing names of other files

## Linux File Structure
- `/home` : contains home directories of all non-root users
- `/root` : Root user's home directory
- `/bin` : binaries - executables for most essential user commands
- `/sbin` : system binaries - essential system binaries programs that admin would use (need superuser privilege)
- `/lib` : library - essential shared libraries that executables from /bin or /sbin use
- `/usr` : user - this was used for home directories
- `/usr/local` : programs that you install (which split its components), will be avalable for all users on the computer
- `/opt` : third-party programs you install (which doesn't split its components)
- `/etc` : place where configuration for system-wide application is stored
- `/tmp` : temporary resources required for some process, kept here temporarily
- `/boot` : contains files required for booting
- `/dev` : devices - location of device files - like webcam, keyboard, hard drive etc.
- `/var` : variable - contains files to which the system writes data during the course of its operation
- `/var/log` : contains log files
- `/var/cache` : contains cached data from application programs
- `/media` : Contains subdirectories, where removable media devices inserted into the computer are mounted
- `/mnt` : Temporary mount points
