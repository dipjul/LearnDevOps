# Linux
- Linux was developed in parallel to
- Unix based operating systems
- No source code of UNIX
- Created by Linus Torvalds
- Clone of UNIX or also called "unix like"
- Linux and MacOS both POSIX compliant

## Linux File System
- File system is used to handle the data management of the storage
- The Linux file system has a hierarchical tree structure With 1 root folder

## Everything in Linux is a File
- Everything in the system is represented by a file descriptor
- Text documents, pictures etc
- Commands, like pwd, ls etc
- Devices like printer, keyboard, usb
- Even directories. Linux makes no difference between a file and adirectory, since a directory is just a file containing names of other files

## Linux File Structure
- `/home` : contains home directories of all non-root users
- `/root` : Root user's home directory
- `/bin` : binaries - executables for most essential user commands
- `/sbin` : system binaries - essential system binaries programs that admin would use (need superuser privilege)
- `/lib` : library - essential shared libraries that executables from /bin or /sbin use
- `/usr` : user - this was used for home directories
- `/usr/local` : programs that you install (which split its components), will be avalable for all users on the computer
- `/opt` : third-party programs you install (which doesn't split its components)
- `/etc` : place where configuration for system-wide application is stored
- `/tmp` : temporary resources required for some process, kept here temporarily
- `/boot` : contains files required for booting
- `/dev` : devices - location of device files - like webcam, keyboard, hard drive etc.
- `/var` : variable - contains files to which the system writes data during the course of its operation
- `/var/log` : contains log files
- `/var/cache` : contains cached data from application programs
- `/media` : Contains subdirectories, where removable media devices inserted into the computer are mounted
- `/mnt` : Temporary mount points

## Basic linux commands
- Every program has: Input and Output
- The output from one program can become the input of another command


*history* command:
- outputs all the commands that were executed

*less* command:
- Displays the contents of a file or a command output, one page at a time
- Allows you to navigate forward and backward through the file
- Mostly used for opening large files, as less doesn't read the entire file, which results in faster load times

**pipe** command: `|`
- Pipes the output of the previous command as an input to the next command
  
  eg. `history | less`
  
*grep*:
- Searches for a particular pattern of characters and displays all lines that contain that pattern
- eg. `history | grep "sudo apt"`

**redirect** operator: `>`
- Takes the output from the previous command and sends it to a file that you give
  ```bash
  # set file contents
  history | grep sudo > sudo-cmds.txt
  
  # append to file contents
  history | grep mv >> sudo-cmds.txt
  ```

## Standard input and Output
Every program has 3 built-in streams:
- STDIN (0) : Standard Input
- STDOUT(1) : Standard Output
- STDERR(2) : Standard Error
  
Standard streams are streams of data that travel from where a program was executed, to the places where the program is processed and then back again
