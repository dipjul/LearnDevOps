# Virtualization & Virtual Machines

## What is Virtualization and a Virtual Machine
- Virtual Machine is commonly shortened to just "VM"
- VM is a virtual computer running on top of another host computer

## How it works - Virtualization
- Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based, or "virtual" version of a computer, with dedicated amounts of CPU, memory, and storage that are "borrowed" from a physical host computer
- Makes it possible that any OS can run on top of any other physical host machine
- The VM is partitioned from the rest of the system, meaning it's completely isolated and can't interfere with the host computer's primary OS

## Hypervisor
- The essential component in the virtualization stack is a piece of software called a hypervisor
- One of the most popular hypervisor is open-source Oracle VM VirtualBox

***Type 1 - Native or Bare Metal***
- That run directly on the host's hardware to control the hardware, and to monitor the guest OS. The guest OS runs on a separate level above the hypervisor
- Examples of this classic implementation of VM architecture are Oracle VM, Microsoft Hyper-V, VMware ESXi.
- Efficient usage of hardware resources (e.g. cloud provider):
  - Use all the resources of a performant big server
  - Users can choose any resource combinations

***Type 2 - Hosted***
- Designed to run within a traditional OS
- A hosted hypervisor adds a distinct software layer on top of the host OS, and the guest OS becomes a third software level above the hardware
- Examples: Oracle VM VirtualBox, VMware Server, Microsoft Virtual PC, KVM, QEMU and Parallels
- Learn and experiment:
  - You don't need to buy a new computer for that
  - You don't endanger your main OS
- Test your app on different OS
- Backing up your existing OS

## Why companies adopt Virtualization?
- Main benefit: Instead of OS being tightly coupled to the hardware, Virtualization gives an abstraction layer, with the following benefits:
- Security: Secure very easily
- Agility and speed: Spinning up a VM is easy and quick, compared to setting up an entire new server
- Cost savings: Efficient usage of hardware resources
- Portable: OS as a portable file (VMI - Virtual Machine Image)
  - Includes OS and all applications on it
  - You can have backups of your entire OS
