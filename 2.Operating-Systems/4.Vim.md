# Vi & Vim
### What is it?
- Vi and Vim are built-in text editors in Linux
- Vi is by far the most distributed and used text editor in Linux
- Depending on your Linux distro, Vim may or may not be installed
- Vim (Vi IMproved) is improved version of Vi
- Built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient

### Use cases for using text editor in CLI
- Small modifications can be faster, especially when you are currently working in the CLI
- Faster to create and edit at the same time
- Supports multiple formats
- When working on a server
- **Git CLI** - writing the Git commit message
- Display Kubernetes configuration files
- Quickly editing one line or character in a file

## Vim modes
```bash
vim {file-name} # if file doesn't exist, it will be created
```
### Command
- This is the default mode
- You can't edit the text
- Whatever you type is interpreted as a command
- Navigate, Search, Delete, Undo etc.
```bash
# Saving and Quitting
:w # Write (save)
:wq # Write and quit
:q # Quit
:q! # Force quit, donâ€™t save changes
:wq! # Force write and quit
```
```bash
# Searching and Replacing
/pattern # Search for pattern
?pattern # Search backward for pattern
n # Repeat search in same direction
N # Repeat search in opposite direction
:%s/old/new/g # Replace all old with new throughout file (gn is better though)
:%s/old/new/gc # Replace all old with new throughout file with confirmations
```
### Insert
- Allows you to enter text
- Pressing Escape, switches you back to command mode
```bash
# Editing
i / a # Start insert mode at/after cursor
I / A # Start insert mode at the beginning/end of the line
o / O # Add blank line below/above current line
Esc or Ctrl+[ # Exit insert mode
d # Delete
dd # Delete line
d10 # Delete 10 lines
u # Undo
0 # Jump to start of line
$ # Jump to end of line
12G # Go to line 12
```
