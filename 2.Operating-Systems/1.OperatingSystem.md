# Operating Systems

## What is an Operating System?
- OS is a software managing
  - computer hardware
  - software resources
  - and provides common services for computer programs
- OS acts as abstraction layer between applications and hardware

## Tasks of an Operating System
###  Resource Allocation and Management
***Process Management (CPU):***
- OS decides which process gets the processor (CPU), when and for how much time and allocates the processor to the process
- CPU is switching so fast that you don't notice it

***Memory Management (RAM):***
- Allocating working memory (RAM = Rapid Access Memory) to applications
- RAM is limited on the computer

***Storage Management (Hard Drive):***
- Also called "secondary memory" - the hard drive
- Persisting data long-term, like files, browser configurations, games, pictures, videos etc

### File Management
- Files are stored in structured way
- A file system is organized into directories
- On Unix system: tree file system
- On Windows OS: multiple root folders

### Device Management
- Manages device communication via their respective drivers
- Activities like:
  - Keeping track of all devices
  - Deciding which process gets the device, when and how long

### Security & Networking
***Security:***
- Managing Users and Permissions
- Each user has its own space and permissions

***Networking***
- Ports and IP addresses
- Transmitting outgoing data from all application ports onto the network, and forwarding arriving network packets to processes

## Operating System Components
### Kernel
- The core program that provides basic services for all other parts of the OS
- Consists of device drivers, dispatcher, scheduler, file system etc.
- One of the first programs loaded on startup
- Controls all hardware resources via device drivers
- Kernel starts the process for app
- Allocates resources to app
- Cleans up the resources when app shuts down

### Application Layer
*On top of Kernel is the application layer*
- For example different Linux distributions:
  - Ubuntu, Mint, CentOS, Debian
- Different application layers, but based on same Linux kernel
- Android is also based on Linux kernel
- Linux Kernel most widely used

### How to interact with Kernel?
- Graphical User Interface
- Command Line Interface
