# Networking

## Introduction to Networking
- Networks can be as small as 2 computers connected at your home and as large as in a large company or connected systems worldwide known as Internet
- Linux has a very strong set of networking instruments to provide and manage routing, bridging, virtual networks etc

### LAN - Local Area Network
- LAN is a collection of devices connected together in one physical location
- Each device has a unique IP address, with which the devices communicate with each other

### IP - Internet Protocol
**IP v4**
- 32 bit
- Address can range from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255

### Switch
- Sits within the LAN Faciliates the connection between all the devices within the LAN

### Router
- Sits between LAN and outside networks (WAN)
- WAN = Wide Area network
- Connects devices on LAN and WAN
- Allows networked devices to access the internet

### Gateway
- IP address of router

### Subnet
- Subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network
- Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into 2 or more networks
- Devices in the LAN belong to same IP address range
- Example of IP address range:

| IP Address | Subnet Mask |
|------------|-------------|
| 192.168.0.0 | 255.255.255.0 |

1) Starting point of IP range, the first IP in the range
2) Sets the IP range
  -  255.255.0.0 - means that 16 bits are fixed : 192.168.x.x
  -  255.255.255.0 - means that 24 bits are fixed : 192.168.0.x
    - Value 255 fixates the Octet
    - Value 0 means free range

**CIDR Block: Classless Inter-Domain Routing**
- CIDR blocks are groups of addresses that share the same prefix and contain the same number of bits
- Again subnet mask dictates how many bits are fixed
- The CIDR notation is a shorthand way of writing this
- CIDR notation looks like this:
  - 192.168.0.0/16 : /16 bits are fixed
  - 192.168.0.0/24: /24 bits are fixed 

## NAT: Network Address Translation
- NAT is a way to map multiple local private addresses to a public one before transferring the information
- So if you make a request to the internet, the router replaces your private IP address with the router's IP

**Why?**
- IP address within LAN are not visible to the outside network or internet, meaning they are private IPs
  - *Security* and protection of devices within LAN
- This was necessary because there is only a limited number of IPv4 addresses available
  - *Reuse* IP addresses

## Firewall
- A Firewall prevents unauthorized access from entering a private network
- So by default, the server is not accessible from outside the LAN
- Using Firewall Rules you can define, which requests are allowed:
  - Which IP address in your network is accessible
  - Which IP address can access your server
  - For example: You can allow any device access your server

## Port
- Every device has a set of ports
- Each port is unique on a device
- You can allow specific ports (doors)
- You can allow specific ports (doors) AND specific IP addresses (guests)
- For every application you need a port
- Different applications listen on specific ports
- There are many standard ports for many applications
  - Web servers: Port 80
  - Mysql DB: Port 3306
  - PostgreSQL DB: Port 5432

## DNS: Domain Name Service
**Translates domain names to IP addresses**
- DNS is the phonebook of the internet
- It translates human readable domain names (for example: www.amazon.com) to machine readable IP addresses

**Domain Names**
- Formed by the rules and procedures of the DNS
- Domain names are organized in subordinate levels (subdomains) of the DNS root domain, which is nameless
- The first-level set of domain names are the top-level domains (TLDs)
- Below are the second-level and third-level domain names that are open for end-users

**ICANN**
- Manages the TLD development and architecture of the internet domain space
- Authorizes Domain Name Registrars, which register and assign domain names

### How DNS resolution works?
- When you enter a website in a browser, a DNS client on your computer needs to look up the corresponding IP address
- It queries DNS servers to resolve the name 
- DNS queries can resolve in different ways
- DNS Cache: A client can sometimes answer a query locally using cached (stored) information obtained from a previous query. Or the DNS server can use its own cache of resource record information to answer a query.

**Request Flow**
- Name Server: Usually your Internet Service Provider
- Root Server: Requests for top level domains
- TLD Server: Stores the address information for top level domains
- Authoritative Name Server: Responsible for knowing everything about the domain, including IP address

## Networking Commands
- `ifconfig` : Getting network configuration
- `netstat` : Network connections, routing tables, interface statistics
- `nslookup` : Query DNS lookup name
- `ping` : Tool to monitor processes running on your Linux system
