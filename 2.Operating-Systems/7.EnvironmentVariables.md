# Environment Variables
 
- Environment variables are KEY=value pairs
- These variables are available system-wide
- Variables store information, which can be changed
- By convention, names are defined in UPPER CASE
- Allow you to customize how the system works and the behavior of the applications on the system

`printenv` - prints all the environment variables

There are 2 use cases for environment variables:
1. OS stores information about the environment 
    - When you have multiple users on a computer, each user can configure its own environment/account by setting preferences
    - OS stores all these configurations in environment variables
    - Some examples:
      - `SHELL=/bin/bash`: Default shell program of the user
      - `HOME=/home/dipjul`: Current user's home directory
      - `USER=dipjul`: Currently logged in user
2. Create our own environment variables  
    -  Use Case: Sensitive data for application
       -  If application needs some credentials, it's not secure to hardcode it directly in the source code
       -  Set these data as env vars on server
       -  By creating these env vars, we make them available in the environment
       -  All apps and processes can now access these env vars
    
 ```bash
 DB_PWD=secretpsswd
 DB_USER=oracledb
 ```
 ```python
 import oracledb.connector
 
 DB_USER = os.getenv('DB_USER')
 DB_PWD = os.environ.get('DB_PWD')
 
 mydb = oracledb.connector.connect(
  host="...",
  user=DB_USER,
  password=DB_PWD
 )
 ```
  
 -  Use Case: Make application more flexible
      -  If your application connects to a database, you need different credentials for different dev, test and prod environments
      -  So you should not hardcode these values in the source code
      -  Instead one option is to set the different values as env vars on each server
      -  Now no need to change the application code, as the values are dynamically set

### Set environment variables
- The export command is used to set environment variables
  - `export MY_VAR="myvalue"`
  - `unset MY_VAR` removes the environment variable
- Env vars created in this way are available only in the current session. If you open a new shell or if you log out all variables will be lost!

### Display environment variables
- Print environment variable in terminal
  - `printenv MY_VAR`

### Persisting environment variables
- To make env vars persistent you need to define those variables in a shell configuration files
- These are shell specific configuration files
- E.g. if you are using bash, you can declare the variables in the `~/.bashrc` file
- Variables set in this file are loaded whenever a bash login shell is entered
- `source ~/.bashrc`: To load the new env vars into the current shell session
- Shell config files are user specific
- Set system-wide env vars in `/etc/environment` file

### PATH
- PATH is a environment variable
- Its value includes a list of directories to executable files, separated by `:`
- Tells the shell which directories to search for the executable in response to our executed command
- When you run a command, the system will search those directories in this order and use the first found executable
- Example value:
  - `PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin`
