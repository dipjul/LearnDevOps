# Introduction
- Application needs to be deployed on a production server
- For that, we want to package application into a single moveable file (artifact), also called "building the code"
- This is what a build tool or package manager tool does

**What is an Artifact?**
- Includes application code and all its dependencies

**What does building the code mean?**
- Compiling the code
- Compressing the code
- Package hundred of files to 1 single file

**What is an artifact repository?**
- Storage for artifacts
- To deploy it for example multiple times, have backup etc.
- Examples: Nexus, Jfrog Artifactory

**Artifacts**
- Artifact files look different for each programming language
- For Java
  - JAR ( Java Archive ) or WAR file
  - Includes whole code plus dependencies, like Spring framework, datetime libraries, pdf processing libraries
- JavaScript's artifact can be a zip or tar file

**Build tools**
- Java Build Tools: Gradle and Maven
