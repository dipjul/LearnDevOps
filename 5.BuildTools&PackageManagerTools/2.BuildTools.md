# Build Tools
## Build an Artifact
- With a Build Tool you can build the artifact
- Specific to the programming language
- Build Tools have command line tool and commands to execute the tasks

## Build Process in Maven or Gradle:
- Installs dependencies
- Compiles and compresses your code
- Gradle
  - Configuration in XML 
- Maven
  - Configuration in Groovy
- Example Build Tools for Java: Gradle and Maven
- Artifact: JAR or WAR file
- Gradle: Artifact in *build* folder
- Maven: Artifact in *target* folder

## Build Tools for Software Development
- Software developers need build tools locally when developing the application
  - run app locally
  - execute tests
  - managing dependencies
- For example, a build tool is used to manage the dependencies of a project
- For that, build tools have a dependencies file:
  - Whenever you need a new dependency, you can add it to the list
- You can find all Java Libraries in Maven Central Repository:
  - Need a library for ElasticSearch database connection?
    - Find a dependency with name and version
    - You add it to dependencies file (e.g. pom.xml)
    - Dependency gets downloaded locally (e.g. local maven repo)

**Run a Java Application:**
- Locally, for example to test:
  - Locate Jar file and execute: `java -jar <name of jar file>`
- On a deployment server:
  - Copy the jar file to server, where application should run and execute `java -jar` command

**Build JavaScript applications**
- Artifact of a JavaScript application is e.g. a zip or tar file
- But no special artifact type defined
- In JS we have package managers and NOT build tools
- For JS we have `npm` and `yarn`
- `package.json` file for dependencies
- Package manager install dependencies, but not used for transpiling JS code
- JavaScript libararies can be found in npm repository
- Command line tool - npm
  - `npm install`: installs the dependencies
  - `npm start`: start the application
  - `npm stop`: stop the application
  - `npm test`: run the tests
  - `npm publish`: publish the artifact
- What does the zip/tar file include?
  - application code, but NOT the dependencies

**Run JavaScript application on server:**
- Copy Zip/Tar file to server
- Unpack zip/tar
- Install dependencies
- Run the application
