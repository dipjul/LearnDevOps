# Build Tools
## Build an Artifact
- With a Build Tool you can build the artifact
- Specific to the programming language
- Build Tools have command line tool and commands to execute the tasks

## Build Process in Maven or Gradle:
- Installs dependencies
- Compiles and compresses your code
- Gradle
  - Configuration in Groovy 
- Maven
  - Configuration in XML
- Example Build Tools for Java: Gradle and Maven
- Artifact: JAR or WAR file
- Gradle: 
  - `./gradlew build`, no need to install gradle, it's bundle with the project
  - Artifact in *build* folder inside the *lib* folder
- Maven: 
  - Need to add the build dependency in the *pom.xml* file
  - `mvm install`
  - Artifact in *target* folder

## Build Tools for Software Development
- Software developers need build tools locally when developing the application
  - run app locally
  - execute tests
  - managing dependencies
- For example, a build tool is used to manage the dependencies of a project
- For that, build tools have a dependencies file:
  - Whenever you need a new dependency, you can add it to the list
  - Maven: *pom.xml* file
  - Gradle: *build.gradle* file
- You can find all Java Libraries in Maven Central Repository:
  - Need a library for ElasticSearch database connection?
    - Find a dependency with name and version
    - You add it to dependencies file (e.g. pom.xml)
    - Dependency gets downloaded locally (e.g. local maven repo)

## Run a Java Application:
- Locally, for example to test:
  - Locate Jar file and execute: `java -jar <name of jar file>`
- On a deployment server:
  - Copy the jar file to server, where application should run and execute `java -jar` command

## Build JavaScript applications
- Artifact of a JavaScript application is e.g. a zip or tar file
- But no special artifact type defined
- In JS we have package managers and NOT build tools
- For JS we have `npm` and `yarn`
- `package.json` file for dependencies
- Package manager install dependencies, but not used for transpiling JS code
- JavaScript libararies can be found in npm repository
- Command line tool - npm
  - `npm install`: installs the dependencies
  - `npm start`: start the application
  - `npm stop`: stop the application
  - `npm test`: run the tests
  - `npm publish`: publish the artifact
- What does the zip/tar file include?
  - application code, but NOT the dependencies

## Run JavaScript application on server:
- Copy Zip/Tar file to server
- Unpack zip/tar
- Install dependencies
- Run the application

## Package javascript code
- JavaScript world is more flexible and less standardized compared to Java
- If application consists of different programming languages:
  - Frontend: React.js (JS Library) 
  - Backend: Java, Node.js, Python etc.
- You can package frontend and backend code separately
- Or in a common artifact file
- If application consists of JavaScript in Frontend and Backend:
  - Frontend: React.js (JS Library) 
  - Backend: Node.js (JS Library)
- You can have a separate package.json file for frontend and backend
- Or have a common package.json file

## Package Frontend Code
- Frontend Code runs in the browser. 
- Browser don't support latest JS versions or other fancy code decorations, like JSX in React.js
- That's why frontend/React Code needs to be transpiled into browser compatible code
- Code needs to be compressed/minified
- There are separate tools for that: Build Tools/Bundler, for example webpack:
  - transpiles 
  - minifies 
  - bundles 
  - compresses the code
- Bundle frontend code with webpack
- Manage dependencies with npm or yarn
- Package everything into a WAR file

## Build Tools for other programming languages
- Java: maven | gradle
- JavaScript: npm | yarn | webpack
- Python: pip
- C/C++: conan
- C#: NuGet
- Golang: dep
- Ruby: RubyGems

## Pattern in all these tools:
- dependency file
  - package.json
  - pom.xml
  - build.gradle 
- repository for dependencies
- command line tool, to: 
  - test
  - start the app
  - build app
  - publish app
- package managers
  - gradle
  - maven
  - npm
  - yarn
  - pip
  - dep
## Publish an artifact
- Build jar or zip package
- Push to artifact repository to save those packages for later use or for downloading on a remote server
- Then you can download (curl, wget) it anywhere

**Change in how we use artifacts**
- We don't keep jar or zip files, because we have Docker
- We don't build them locally, because we have Jenkins and other Build Automation Tools
