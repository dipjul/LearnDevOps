# Build Tools and Docker
## Introduction
- No need to build and move different artifact types (e.g. Jar, War, Zip)
  - Just 1 artifact type: Docker Image
  - We build those Docker images from the applications
- No need for a repository for each file type
  - Just 1 Docker Image
- No need to install dependencies on the server!
  - Execute install command inside Docker Image
- Docker makes it easier 
  - Docker Image is an artifact
- Docker Image is an alternative for all other artifact types
- You don't need to install npm or java on the server
  - Execute everything in the Image
- You still need to build the application!

## Why should you know these Build Tools as a DevOps engineer?
- Help developers building the application, because you know where and how it will run on deployment servers
- You need to configure the build automation tool or CI/CD Pipeline, like execute tests on the build servers, build and package into Docker Image, run the application on server

- So, you don't execute anything locally
