# Working with Digital Ocean

## Setup Server on DigitalOcean
- Servers on DigitalOcean are called "Droplets"
- Droplets are Linux-based virtual machines (VMs)

**Steps:**  
1. Pre-Requisite: Create DigitalOcean account (with new signup credits - free tier)
2. Configure SSH keys
3. Create a Droplet with Linux Ubuntu distribution
4. Open SSH port 22 on server using firewall configuration
5. SSH into the server using its public IP address
6. Install Java to run Java applications on it

**Configure SSH keys**  
- To be able to access any server on DO from local computer using SSH

**Create a Droplet**  
- With Linux Ubuntu distribution

**Open SSH port 22**  
- Open SSH port 22 on the server by creating a new *Firewall configuration*
- Inbound Rules = for incoming traffic
- Outbound Rules = for outgoing traffic

**SSH into the server** 
- By using its public IP address

**Install Java**  
- Check if java is installed and get installation commands
- Install java to run Java applications on it


## Run packaged Java Application
- In real world, applications will run on a remote server!
- Server prepared to run java application jar

**Steps:**  
1. Build jar file
2. Copy to remote server
3. Run the application

## Security Best Practices
- Create separate Linux user on remote server (as you learned in Linux module)
  - Every cloud platform configuration for their remote servers is different
  - On droplet, per default you work with the "root" user
  - Create a new "admin" user
  - Using the "admin" user, create own users for each application you run (e.g. nexus, jenkins, my-app)
- Give it only the permission it needs to run that application
- Don't work with the root user
