# Introduction

- **Databases are used to persist data**
- Users can create, read, update or delete entries in a database
- Also called CRUD operations

## Database in software development process
- Developers need database for local development
  - Connect to a development database to develop the new features
  - Connect to a test database to test the new feature with realistic data
- 2 ways for developers to work with DB

### Option 1:
- **Each developer installs DB locally**
- Each developer has own DB with own test data
- can't mess up someone else's test DB data
- start from empty DB | need realistic test data
- install and setup DB for EVERY developer

### Option 2:
- **Shared DB hosted remotely**
- no need for local installation
- start coding right away
- test data available right from the start
- can't play around without affecting others!

## Configure Database Connection
- The DB connection is configured in the application's code
- Each programming language has a library/module for DB connection
- You have to tell the library:
  - *WHICH database to talk to*
    - Database Endpoint
  - *HOW to AUTHENTICATE with that DB*
    - Credentials

```java
// Java sample code for configuring mysql database
MysqlDataSource dataSource = nwq MysqlDataSource();
dataSource.setUser("user");
dataSource.setPassword("pwd");
dataSource.setUrl("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db-name");
```
- Better: Do not hardcode database connection data in source code
- Best Practice: DON'T check in credentials in code
- Define in 1 place as environment variables
- Configure DB connection from OUTSIDE
  - Define only variables in code
  - Set endpoint and credentials from outside for each environment (for example dev, test, prod)
  - Depending on environment (dev, test, prod) connects to different DB
- The way to do this, is to pass environment variables on application start-up
- How to pass envrionment variables:
  - From Command Line
  - Configure in code editor
  - **Use properties/configuration files**
- The best option is to pass them via a properties or configuration file
- In a Java/Spring application you can define the values in a Spring properties file: 
  - Values defined in a properties file
  - we usually have a property file for each env
- Nodejs application with configuration file:
  - we usually use a json file that contains the properties

## Databases in Production
- Application connects to database
- This means database needs to be available , when application starts
- So before application is deployed, we need to install and configure database
- Data is important so we need to secure them:
  - Replicate database
  - Do regular backups
  - Make sure it performs under high load
