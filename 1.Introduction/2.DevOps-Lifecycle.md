## Different steps:
- Plan
- Code
- Build
- Test
- Release
- Deploy
- Operate
- Monitor

### Plan
In this stage, teams identify the business requirement and collect end-user feedback. 
They create a project roadmap to maximize the business value and deliver the desired product during this stage.

### Code
The code development takes place at this stage. 
The development teams use some tools and plugins like Git to streamline the development process,
which helps them avoid security flaws and lousy coding practices.

### Build
This is where we'll kick off the first of our automation processes because we're going to take their code and we're going to build
it depending on what language they're using it may be transpiring it or compiling it or it might be creating a docker image from 
that code either way we're going to go through that process using our ci cd pipeline

### Test
Once the build is ready, it is deployed to the test environment first to perform several types of testing like user acceptance test,
security test, integration testing, performance testing, etc., using tools like JUnit, Selenium, etc., to ensure software quality

### Release
 The build is ready to deploy on the production environment at this phase. 
 Once the build passes all tests, the operations team schedules the releases or deploys multiple releases to production, depending on the organizational needs.

### Deploy
Deployment is like the end game of this whole thing because deployments are when we put the code into production and 
it's not until we do that that our business realizes the value from all the time effort and hard work that you and 
your team have put into this product up to this point.

### Operate
The goal is to always automate it when possible but ideally you want to deploy automatically as part of your automation process. 
Another operational thing that you do is include like a feedback loop from production back to your ops team letting them know about key events that happened in production such as a deployment.

### Monitor
In this stage, the DevOps pipeline is monitored based on data collected from customer behavior, application performance, etc. 
Monitoring the entire environment helps teams find the bottlenecks impacting the development and operations teamsâ€™ productivity.
You need to have monitoring for memory utilization CPU utilization disk space, API endpoint, response time, 
how quickly that endpoint is responding and a big part of that as well is logs.
Logs give developers the ability to see what is happening without having to access production systems.
Troubleshooting operational issues related to auto-scaling required monitoring in place, without it we wouldn't even know there's a problem.

## Continuous Delivery
***Continuous Delivery = Plan > Code > Build > Test***

## Continuous Integration
Continuous integration is the most crucial phase in the entire DevOps lifecycle. 
In this phase, updated code or add-on functionalities and features are developed and integrated into existing code. 
Bugs are detected and identified in the code during this phase at every step through unit testing. This step makes integration a continuous approach where code is tested at every commit.

***Continuous Integration = Plan > Code > Build > Test > Release***

## Continuous Deployment
Continuous deployment is the part of the DevOps lifecycle where code is deployed on production servers. 
It includes configuration management to make the deployment of code on servers accurate and smooth. This practice made the continuous delivery of new features in production possible. 
Containerization tools also help in the deployment process by providing consistency across development, testing, production, and staging environments.

If you have a successful release from your continuous integration then move to Continuous Deployment which brings in the following phases:

***CI Release is Success = Continuous Deployment = Deploy > Operate > Monitor***

You can see these three Continuous notions above as the simple collection of phases of the DevOps Lifecycle.
