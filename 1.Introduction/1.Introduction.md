***Intersection of Development & Operations***  
***DevOps is about making the process of continuous delivery fast and with minimal errors***  

The DevOps mindset or culture is about shrinking the long, drawn-out software release process from potentially years to being able to drop smaller releases more frequently. 
From a DevOps perspective, Development, Testing and Deployment all land with the DevOps team. 
To make this as effective and efficient as possible we must leverage Automation.

## Responsibilities of a DevOps Engineer
### DevOps is the link between the Development and Operations
A DevOps engineer will need to understand how a developer works and the systems, tools and processes they are using.
At a very high level, you are going to need to know how the application is configured to talk to all of its required services or data services. 
It is also likely that we need to communicate with other services in our network or environment, 
so we also need to have that level of knowledge around networking and configuring that.


In DevOps we are constantly looking at how we get new features and bug fixes into our products. 
How do we manage this in an automated, efficient way which also needs to include testing? 
This is one of the main tasks for a DevOps engineer, and the important thing here is not just figure out how to do this once but many times over.

## DevOps Lifecycle
### Development
As a DevOps engineer you are probably not the one creating this plan or coding the application for the end user, this will be a skilled developer. 
But it also would not hurt for you to be able to read some of the code so that you can make the best infrastructure decisions moving forward for your application. 
Best practices would require a code repository to store and collaborate on the code, this could be private or public and could be hosted or privately deployed.

### Testing
The QA phase is the part of software development where you are testing your code in all the different environments that you have available to you. 
More frequently we see containers being used for simulating the test environment which overall can improve on cost overheads of physical or cloud infrastructure. 
This phase is also likely going to be automated as part of the next area which is Continuous Integration.

### Integration
Integration is at the middle of the DevOps lifecycle. It is the practice in which developers require to commit changes to the source code more frequently. 
This allows for early detection of issues or bugs before the next phase. With every commit, your application can go through the automated testing phases.

### Deployment
This is the stage where the code is deployed to the production servers. 
This is where Application Configuration Management and Infrastructure as Code could play a key part in your DevOps lifecycle. 
This then leads us onto platforms like Kubernetes which would be orchestrating those containers and making sure you have the desired state available to your end users.

### Monitoring
We have our application that we are continuously updating with new features and functionality. 
We also have the application running in our environment that can be continually keeping the required configuration and performance. 
Now we need to capture that feedback wheel about the features that have been implemented and how the end users would like to make these better for them. 
This is going to allow us to make better decisions about enhancements to the application in future releases.

Reliability is a key factor here as well; at the end of the day, we want our application to be available all the time it is required. 
This then leads to other observability, security and data management areas that should be continuously monitored and 
feedback can always be used to better enhance, update and release the application continuously.

Cloud Apps & Data are running and stored somewhere you should be monitoring this continuously to make sure if things change from a resources point of view your costs are not causing some major financial pain on your Cloud Bills. 
DevOps should be used in many different positions such as Cloud-Native engineer/architect, virtualization admin, cloud architect/engineer, and infrastructure admin. 
This is to name a few but the reason for using DevOps Engineer above was really to highlight the scope of the process used by any of the above positions.
