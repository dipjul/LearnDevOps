# Introduction

## Version Control
### What is Version Control?
- Also known as "source control"
- Practice of tracking and managing changes to software code
- It enables multiple people to simultaneously work on a single project
- Code is hosted centrally on the internet
- Every developer has an entire copy of the code locally

### Basic Concepts of Version Control
- Version Control keeps a history of changes
- Every code change and file is tracked!
- You can revert commits 
- Each change labelled with commit message  
- **Remote Git Repository**: where the code is hosted, e.g. on Gitlab or GitHub
- **Local Git Repository**: local copy of the code on your machine
- **Git Client**: to connect and execute git commands can be UI or Command Line Tool
- Code is fetched ("pulled") from remote repo and "pushed" to it
- Most of the time, Git knows how to merge changes automatically
- But you have a "Merge Conflict", when e.g. same line was changed. Then you need to resolve it manually
- To avoid merge conflicts:
  - Best Practice: Push and Pull often from remote repository to stay in sync
- Note: Breaking changes doesn't affect you until you pulled the new code

## Working with Git

- `git add <file>`:
  - To include the changes of a file into the next commit
  - Moves the changes from "working directory" to the "staging area"

- `git commit -m "commit message"`:
  - To save your changes in your local repository 
  - Creates a new commit, which you can go back to later if needed

- `git push <remote> <branch-name>`:
  - After committing your changes, you want to send your changes to the remote Git server
  - Uploads your commits to the remote repo

## Setup Git Repository
### Remote Repository
- Different Git Repositories to register:
  - GitLab
  - Github
- These are platforms that host your repository
- Companies have own Git servers hosted by them
- Your repository can be private or public. E.g. Private for companies, Public for open source projects
- You can do a lot via the Platforms UI

### Local Repository
- Having the remote repository set up, you need a way to connect with the remote repository to copy or `clone` git project to your local machine
- Git client needs to be installed: 
  - UI client
  - Command Line Tool
- You need to authenticate with GitHub/GitLab/...
- For that, your public SSH Key must be added to the remote platforms
- If you have already an existing project locally, you can initialize a git repository with `git init`
- Then you can push it to GitLab/GitHub/...

## Branching
- Branch is based on main branch. So, it starts from same codebase
- When finished, the complete branch can be merged back to the main branch
- Goal is to have a stable main branch, ready for production deployment

## Merge Requests or Pull Requests
- For that we have "merge request" or also called "pull request"
- It's basically a request to merge one branch into another (usually in the main branch)
- Reviewer can see the changes made and either approve or decline the merge request
- Best Practice: Other developer reviews code changes before merging

## Why to know Git as DevOps Engineer?
- Infrastructure as Code
  -  you write code (configuration files and scripts) to create and provision infrastructure
- Automation Scripts
  - you write automation scripts e.g. with Python to automate different tasks
- Just like software code, files should be:
  - Tracked - history of changes
  - Securely stored in one place
  - Shareable to collaborate as team
- CI/CD Pipeline and Build Automation
  - CI means: On each merge, checkout code from repository, test and build application
  - For that, you need integration for the build automation tool with application git repository
  - You need to setup integration with build automation tool and git repository
  - You need to know git commands for example for:
    - Getting commit hash of specific commit
    - Check if changes happened in frontend or backend code

## Best Practices
### Commit-related best practices:
- Use descriptive and meaningful commit messages
- Commit in relatively small chunks
- Commit only related work 
- Adequately configure the commit authorship (name and email address) with git config

### Avoiding very large deviations between local and remote repository:
- Keep your feature/bugfix branch up-to-date with remote master and/or develop branch. So pull often from remote git repository
- Branches shouldn’t be open for too long or master branch should be merged into your feature/bugfix branch often

## Other:
- Don’t "git push" straight to main branch
- Use -force push carefully! Do NOT force push into master or develop branches or better only when working alone in a branch
- Create a separate branch for each feature or bugfix and name the branch with prefix “feature/xx” and “bugfix/xxx” respectively
- Doing Code Reviews via Merge Requests
- Use .gitignore file to ignore e.g. editor specific files, build folders
